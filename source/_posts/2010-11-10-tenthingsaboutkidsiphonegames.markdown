Ten things about children's games on the iPhone, learned from watching the usage patterns of a two year old and four year old girl.

1. Forget the ads - they just confuse the kids and cause the phone to get thrown across the room or car. 99 cents is the ideal price point.

1. Keep the intro focused and to the point. You get about 30 seconds to make an impression that will determine whether they will actually play the game.

1. Too many options at the beginning causes frustration - keep the first parts of the game ridiculously simple.

1. Once the game is underway and the player is engaged then layer in some challenge and complexity to keep the player stimulated.

1. Invest in a good artwork for the icon. First impressions matter a lot.

1. Things that make a good icon: pictures of dessert foods, cartoon animals, jewelery, sparkles.

1. For coloring games, keep the drawings simple. Little fingers get frustrated trying to point in tiny spaces.

1. If the game involves preparing food, you had better be able to 'eat' your virtual concoction.

1. When eating your virtual goodies, there should be loud, garish sound effects. Nom Nom Nom!

1. Cheering when the player completes a level is a good way to encourage playing the next level.
