Years ago I stumbled across a [random blog post](http://jackdied.com/python/46) that has stuck with me to this day about 
[Rabbit Starvation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_starvation). Rabbit Starvation is the notion that if you're lost in the woods
in the middle of winter, it's tempting to go out hunting rabbits because there are lots of them. However, once you consider that it 
takes energy to catch rabbits, and they have practically no fat, you burn off precious fat reserves to eat a food low in calories.
According to the Arctic explorer [Vilhjalmur Stefansson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilhjalmur_Stefansson):

> This trouble is worst, so far as North America is concerned, among those forest Indians who depend at times on rabbits, 
> the leanest animal in the North, and who develop the extreme fat-hunger known as rabbit-starvation. Rabbit eaters, if they 
> have no fat from another source—beaver, moose, fish—will develop diarrhoea in about a week, with headache, lassitude and 
> vague discomfort. If there are enough rabbits, the people eat till their stomachs are distended; but no matter how much 
> they eat they feel unsatisfied. Some think a man will die sooner if he eats continually of fat-free meat than if he eats nothing...

It's stated much more succinctly in [How to Stay Alive in the Woods](http://www.amazon.com/How-Stay-Alive-Woods-Self-Preservation/dp/1579122213):

> One would probably be better off on just water, then on rabbit and water

Some believe that Rabbit Starvation is apocryphal and others believe it's what ultimately killed
[Christopher McCandless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_McCandless), but it makes for a wonderful parable for the business person.
Even though I read this post and thought I had absorbed its message, my business nearly succumbed to it. When things get slow, and
trust me, at some point they will, it's tempting to just start grabbing every piece of business you can. There are lots of small jobs out
there and for a short period of time, it can be fun to work on so many different things, but most people can't create a sustainable, growing
business out of small projects.

Don't get me wrong, I love small projects and small clients. There is nothing like being able to do a few hours of work and really move
the needle for someone's business. They are also a great opportunity to think creatively, be agile and minimalist, and perhaps even learn
something new. People skills, communication skills and creative problem solving are a must in that environment. But as the wilderness 
survival folklore teaches, if you are going to survive the winter, it's better to go hunting for bigger game. Rabbits are delicious 
and as part of a balanced diet can be very good for you, but you can't live off of rabbits alone, and they're not the best choice when
you're starving, tempting as they may be.
