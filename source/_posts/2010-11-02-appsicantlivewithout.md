I always like to see what apps people use every day and make a part of their daily existence. Sometimes there are hidden
gems, or truly useful things that I have never heard of. So without further ado, apps that I cannot live without:

[Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) All of my really important files go here. Dropbox makes online backups and syncs files to all of
your other computers running Dropbox. If I save a file there, I know it's on all of my other computers right away. I can access the
files on my phone or online, or on any computer. The best thing is that this all happens automatically. It. Just. Works.

[Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) What Evernote lacks in style, it makes up for in substance and ubiquity. Evernote is a note-taking
application that syncs with an upstream server, so any notes I write on my computer show up on my phone and vice versa. Notes are easily
searchable and browsable. I think it also supports photos and character recognition, but I've never tried any of those things.

[Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com) This is a free project tracking application developed by [Pivotal Labs](http://www.pivotallabs.com),
a software consulting company, to manage all of their client projects. Therefore, it's a great fit for the type of work that I do. It
does a great job of staying out of your way and it lets small, agile teams work together easily. It's my go-to app for projects nowadays.

[Skitch](http://www.skitch.com) Sometimes when trying to illustrate a point, it's good to take a screen shot, draw some arrows and write
some text. Skitch focuses on making that task brain-dead simple. It also shares the files online, and my favorite feature, if you have a Web 
form with a file upload, you can drag the tab at the bottom to the upload button and you don't have to browse around looking for it.

[Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/) A simple time tracking and invoicing application. While I'm working, or at the end of the day, I'll
enter all of my project hours. Then at the end of the month I press the 'Create Invoice' button and it will send out an invoice. It turned
invoicing from an endeavor that took half a day, to a few clicks and about half an hour. Totally worth about $12 per month. It will also
show you the status of all your invoices and let your clients pay online with a credit card. There's more stuff too, but that's what I
use on a daily basis.

Anyone else out there, what can't you live without?
