I reached my goal yesterday for my iPhone app: have a set of wireframes complete. I am a fan of using wireframes or mockups to determine scope and requirements when working with clients. It is a good way to talk about functionality in a way that is easy to visualize.

In this case, I was able to figure out what screens there should be, and what should be on them. I was also able to show them to my [brilliant wife](http://www.keetonpr.com/blog) and she was able to give me some feedback as a 'normal user'.

So what are wireframes? Wireframes are mockups of how an application should look and feel. There is really not a right or wrong way of doing wireframes. A lot of people like graph paper and a ruler. Lots of people like PowerPoint, and there are many other tools that people use. Here are a few off the top of my head:

* [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/)
* [Mockingbird](https://gomockingbird.com/)
* [Adobe Fireworks](http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/)
* [PowerPoint](http://www.raizlabs.com/blog/294/wireframing-in-powerpoint)
* [Keynote](http://keynotekungfu.com/)
* [Visio](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visio/archive/2009/12/22/wireframe-shapes-in-visio-2010.aspx)
* [Omnigraffle](http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils)
* [Google Drawings](http://mortenjust.com/2010/04/19/a-wireframe-kit-for-google-drawings/)

Needless to say there are lots of tools that one can use to create wireframes, the only advice I can give you on how to choose:

**The best wireframe tool is the one that you have, you know well, and you can use to create wireframes quickly**

I am not an expert on design or wireframes, but as someone who finds them useful, there are some tips that I've found useful:

* **Don't be a perfectionist** The goal is not to create a realistic mockup. That comes later. The point is to figure out what information you need to display and what functionality needs to be there.
* **Don't worry about every little button** If your app needs a video player, it's ok to put a big box labeled "Video Player" on the screen
* **Get feedback quickly** As soon as you have something to show, show it to some people to get some feedback and suggestions. See if people can tell what the heck you're talking about.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. One UX Designer offers some good [tools](http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/wireframing-tips-tools-and-techniques/) and [tips](http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/wireframing-tips-tools-and-techniques-pt-2/) on [uxbooth.com](http://www.uxbooth.com/).
