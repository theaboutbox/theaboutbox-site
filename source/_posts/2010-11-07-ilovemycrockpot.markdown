I have a confession: I love my crock pot. It is a marvelous and incredible invention, but I almost never hear anyone in my generation speak of them.
When we purchased a new house, I had asked my grandmother what we should get for the house. "Buy the largest Crock Pot you can" was her advice.

The reason why is simple: spend a few minutes in the morning putting a bunch of stuff in, and then by dinner time you have a delicious meal, not having
to do any more work. Those who have children understand that the hours between 5:00 and 7:00 are the witching hour. The kids are tired, they are hungry,
they are winding down from a busy day, and the less time futzing around in the kitchen before getting food on the table, the better.

While roasts in the crock pot are delicious, they can do so much more. Here is a recipe that my mother in law gave me, slightly modified:

**Chicken Tacos**

* Four Chicken Thighs
* One Package Taco Seasoning
* Two Cans Ro-Tel's (Or two cans tomatoes + green chiles to taste)

Put salt and pepper on the chicken thighs and cook them skin side down until the skin is brown. (I like to do this to get rid of some of the fat)
Put all ingredients in the crock pot together and stir. About an hour before serving, shred the meat with a fork and mix well. Serve with Tortillas
and the rest of your favorite taco fixins.

Anyone else have any favorite crock pot recipes?
