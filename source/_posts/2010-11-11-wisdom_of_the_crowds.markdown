We've been trying to figure out what the girls want for Christmas, which is not an easy task, mainly because when you ask them what they would want, they point to every single item in the toy store. The challenge is to find something that makes it past the first 24 hours and still gets some play.

I have to admit that my typical strategy is to go to Amazon, or FatBrain and find the highest rated toys for [three year old girls](http://www.fatbraintoys.com/toys/toys_by_ages/girls/top_picks_3.cfm) or whatever other age group, and get something there.

Perhaps I'm lazy but sometimes technology does make life easier.
