title: Resolved - An iPhone app by the end of the Month

I was having coffee with a [good friend](http://www.industryof.com/) who was relaying his experience developing an
[iPhone app](http://www.photoduoapp.com/) and he said that while he had long suspected that I am a fool for not
having some applications in the App Store, he now has data to prove it.

Therefore I resolve and state publicly that by the end of the month I will have an application submitted to the
App store. During our coffee, I had arrived at a very simple idea that will make a perfect foray into app
development. I don't know how public I am going to make the concept and design process (It's like sharing the
names of my children before they were born..) but to meet my goal, I've done the following:

* Renewed my iPhone Developer Program membership
* Downloading the latest app SDK
* Started to draw some [wireframes](http://www.flickr.com/groups/ilovewireframes/) to sketch out the screens and how they are linked together

19 days to go...Putting this resolution out there is a good way to force myself to be on track and accountable.
My goal for today is to have all the software installed and a first version of wireframes complete.
