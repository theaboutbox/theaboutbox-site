This month is National Novel Writing Month. I don't think I'm ambitious enough to do that this year. I had briefly flirted
with the notion of starting a more technical book, but I'm still trying to get my business structured so I have some help 
and backup on the technical side, so I don't think I'd be able to follow through on that commitment. One of these days, perhaps
I will write that book on styling Flex applications. I've learned a lot that I haven't seen posted anywhere else.

Fortunately for those of us with slightly more modest writing ambitions, it is also [National Blog Posting Month](http://www.nablopomo.com/).
That makes this month as good as any to turn over a new leaf, and put something out there. And maybe while I'm at it, I'll clean up the
rest of the site, too.

There is a lot of value to writing on a regular basis. [My wife](http://www.keetonpr.com/) runs a Public Relations
firm, updates her Web site regularly, and two of her most recent clients said they found her "on the Internet". When Google turns into
one of your best lead sources, definitely something is going right.
