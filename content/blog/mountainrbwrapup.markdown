excerpt: About one week after mountain.rb, some thoughts
---
I was at the [mountain.rb](http://mountainrb.com) conference last week and I've been wanting to write up some impressions.

First of all, the Boulder Theater is one of the best venues for a conference I've ever seen. It was very easy to mingle between talks
and the single-track format really helps generate a sense of intimacy - everyone is listening to the same talks so there is more of a
shared experience. The sound and video worked great. [Marty](http://haughtcodeworks.com) did a great job bringing great food and coffee, 
and the bar opened at 4:00 in the afternoon. I loved that the conference was in my home state - it felt good to know a lot of people, and
feel totally at ease meeting some new people. I'm only a little sad that I had so much car trouble and couldn't really participate in the
before and after events.

For me, the most noteworthy thing about the conference is what seems to be a cultural change in the Ruby scene these days. As late as last year's RubyConf, 
most of the talks were about crazy, cutting edge things people were doing. Controlling blimps, composing music, exchanging data between 
Erlang and Ruby apps, etc. Lately at conferences, not so much. Yes, there were technical talks, but most of the talks were about the 
squishier things: what do developers need to know about sales? How to be a good Open Source citizen? How do we choose the right tool 
for the job? How do we work in brownfield projects without fear? If anything there was a sense of exhaustion at the crazy pace that new
libraries and tools appear.

Perhaps this signals a sea change of Ruby as a fringe programming language, with Rails as an edgy and sometimes controversial Web framework
to widely-accepted and sometimes default implementation technologies. Perhaps with the more mainstream acceptance of Ruby and Rails, there
comes a desire to focus on how to get stuff done, how to make businesses work and how to actually deliver projects. It brings me back to the
earlier days of my career, where deciding to write server technology in Java was a controversial decision that landed me in the CTO's office
multiple times for tense arguments and discussions, and the Java community was the center of innovation. It's funny how twelve short years 
later the Java people are sometimes looked upon as dinosaurs.

Personally I hope that the Ruby community does not get as hijacked by business interests as the Java community did, and it remains one
of the best places to experiment, do silly things, put crazy stuff out there and push the edges, that culturally and technologically it
remains fertile ground for hackers and professionals. Judging by the colorful language in the panels and talks my hopes are high that 
the community won't go all 'business casual'. That being said, I'd like to see a little less [CADT](http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html) and 
more libraries actually developed to completion, even if that means fewer choices.
