title: Maybe That's Why my Internet is so Slow

Lately I've been impressed with how well Netflix has been executing, and how much I'm liking their streaming service. Even though they don't have
a lot of 'grown up' stuff, they have just about every program my kids watch. As a side note, I wonder how this is going to change the experience
of being a child. When I was a kid, television programs were on at a specific time and you were not in control of what you watched. Now my girls
like to request specific episodes of Dora or Blue's Clues and they are surprised whenever they can't watch what they want, when they want.

It looks like Netflix is trying to get rid of DVDs, in general. They introduced a new [streaming only plan](http://blog.netflix.com/2010/11/new-plan-for-watching-instantly-plus.html)
and they are raising the prices on their DVD plans. I'm also hearing statistics that Netflix currently accounts for about 
[23 percent of prime-time Internet traffic](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20020434-17.html).

That leaves me wondering a few things. Is all that bandwidth really cheaper than sending DVDs around in the mail? I've seen CDN pricing plans and
it would be very easy to take up more than $7.99 per month in bandwidth charges. Is this pricing sustainable?

Also, why do we bother having DVDs on our plan. We stream content just about every day but the DVDs have been gathering dust for a while.

Finally, my Internet connection has been slow as molasses lately. I blame Netflix.
