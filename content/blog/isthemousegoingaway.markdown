It's been fascinating watching our children (2 and 4) interact with technology. Imagine being that age and never knowing a time that
you did not have a powerful, connected computing device at your fingertips. I don't think we've begun to see the implications of that.

Not only is communication and computing technology ubiquitous, it's easier to use than ever before. Have you ever seen a three year old
use an iPhone? If you haven't, find a three year old and take them to the Apple store. Our oldest daughter, at the age of three, 
could find songs to play and watch movies. At the age of four and a half, she shoots movies and finds games on the App store that she
pleads with me to buy. *(Side note, games for four year olds could be a very lucrative app segment)*

Part of this, I am sure, is that our children are digital natives. They have been exposed to technology since birth. Part of this is
improvements in industrial design - interacting with an iPhone there is very little hardware in the way. It is very much like interacting
with a physical object, with all of the [affordances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) of a physical object. I am sure that is why
even computer newbies can use iPhone/iPad type devices easily.

With a little bit of training, our oldest daughter figured out how to use a trackpad. It's one layer of abstraction away from interacting with
the screen itself, so now she can go to [PBS Kids](http://pbskids.org) and find some dress up games. *(Another side note, why is it that our 
four year old is the only one in the house that can reliably print things?)* *(Side side note: four year olds use a lot of paper)*

Then one day, I took both of the girls to the Apple store. They sat down next to the iMacs that are strategically placed by the genius bar,
looked at the computers with mice attached, and had no clue what to do, picked up the iPod touches also strategically placed by the genius bar,
at kid level, and played away.

Therefore, I have a prediction. The mouse, in another 5 years, is going the way of the [floppy disk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk). 
Remember what those are?
