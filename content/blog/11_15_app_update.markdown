I am still working on my resolution to submit an iPhone app to the app store by the end of the month.

After looking at the wireframes and thinking about the application, I had come up with a simpler way of presenting the
information that my app is generating. So far, super early in the development stages, I've noticed two things:

1) Writing the app is going to be very straightforward. The major challenges are going to be design issues: How do I 
present information clearly, how am I going to describe the app succinctly in a manner the people are going to find
searching the app store, and how am I going to make the app look really nice.

2) Don't use Google Chrome to upload a certificate request to the iPhone developer portal. Use Safari.

My goal for tomorrow: Get one screen of my app running on my phone.
