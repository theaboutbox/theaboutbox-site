I write software for a living and I am very good at it, but I have to take parts of my software developer personality and put it on the
shelf when I am done working, otherwise life can be difficult at home. I don't know of many other jobs where traits that make someone
good at their jobs make them difficult at home.

Here are some traits that make developers hard to live with:

**We argue constantly** - Part of the development process is sussing out the best way to solve a particular problem. If one of my colleagues
comes to me with a problem and an approach for solving it, the first thing I'll do is poke holes in the idea. I'll think of everything
that is wrong with the idea, I'll try to find situations where it won't work.

This is a bad thing to do at home for a number of reasons. It turns out that spouses really don't like it when we try to shoot down every
suggestion they make. Also if we coldly analyze every single concern and treat it as a problem to be picked apart and solved, it can appear
that we lack empathy.

**We aggressively eliminate distractions** - When we work, we strive to be in what we call a [flow state](http://goo.gl/wPK7t).
It's a foreign concept to a lot of non engineers, but there is really nothing like it in the world. There are those rare days where you start
working, and next thing you know, it's the end of the day and it didn't even feel like any time passed. Sometimes we'll even forget to eat.
We chase Flow, it's like a drug. So when we're doing something and someone asks a question, our first desire is to get back to that state
of pristine concentration. It is also in this mental state where we get most of our real work done - when solving a tricky technical problem
sometimes there are so many things we need to keep in our heads, that we have to stop paying attention to absolutely everything around us,
and it takes a while to get ourselves back into a normal mental state.

The problem with this is that sometimes it seems like we don't care about our significant others' problems when they ask us questions while
we're working. I heard somewhere that it takes about fifteen minutes to get back in the zone following an interruption. 

**We favor efficiency over diplomacy** - I remember one day that I was cooking dinner, and my wife asked me what I thought of a particular
home improvement project. She explained it to me, and I said "I think that's a *horrible* idea." Then I went back to cooking. Needless to say that
went over like a lead balloon. At work, we don't spend much time mincing words. If we're discussing intricate concepts or complicated
problems, it's hard enough to communicate a detailed design or complicated problem, or point out a flaw in someone's reasoning without
having to worry about phrasing everything or walking on eggshells. The best developers check their egos at the door.

So, a question for anyone out here reading this? What traits do you need at work to be successful that cause havoc at home?
