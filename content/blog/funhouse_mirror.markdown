I ended up getting swamped in work yesterday so I didn't get around to writing a post, so as penance, I'll have two posts today. Hopefully I'll
be posting every day on average.

Children can be demanding. If they want something, they don't hesitate to ask, no matter what you're doing at the time. In those situations,
I'll frequently respond "Just a minute!" and sometimes if they're lucky I get around to it in a minute, but sometimes I get distracted and
I get many impatient queries before they get a glass of milk, or a bowl of cheerios, or their swim goggles or whatever else it happens to
be. I'm a space cadet, what can I say.

For the past two days, when I've picked up my two year old from the babysitter, I say "It's time to go, let's put away our toys" and she
responds: "Just a minute!" and then she merrily goes about playing with her toys.

When you have children, you frequently see yourself in the funhouse mirror. Sometimes I wonder if the best we can hope for is that they
magnify our best parts more than not.
