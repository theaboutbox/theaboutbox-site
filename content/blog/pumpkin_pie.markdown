The other day I made another crack at from-scratch pumpkin pie. This time the filling turned out to be absolutely amazing and really easy to make.
I hate to say it, but it topped the recipe that I found after diligently searching the Internet for the perfect pumpkin pie recipe. As for 
where I found it? It was on the sticker on the pumpkin I purchased at Target. I made some very insubstantial changes for convenience. I want
to preserve this recipe for posterity so I can make it in the future. Without further ado:

So Easy Pumpkin Pie
-------------------

Prepare pumpkin puree:

* Cut pumpkin in half and scoop out seeds
* Place cut side down. Roast at 350 for 1.5 hours
* Let cool and scoop out flesh. Puree in food processor until smooth

Beat until smooth:

* 1 1/3 cup smooth pumpkin
* 1 can sweetened condensed milk
* 1 egg
* 2 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie seasoning
* 1 cup hot water

Pour into 9 inch pie shell. Place foil ring around edge of crust. Bake at 375 for 55-65 minutes. (I baked mine for 60 minutes)
